### Answers

Once you have successfully run a simulation, use your python skills to **analyze the simulation results**:

1. What were the **inputs** you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
2. What percentage of the population became **infected** at some point before the virus burned out?
3. What percentage of the population **died** from the virus?
4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, **how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected**?
